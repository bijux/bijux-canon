# Scope and Non-Goals

This page names the line that keeps `bijux-canon-ingest` useful instead of bloated.
The point of a package boundary is not to make work harder. It is to keep
neighboring packages from silently accumulating overlapping authority.

The non-goals matter as much as the goals. A package becomes easier to trust
when readers can see what it refuses to absorb just because the code happens to
be nearby.

The foundation pages are the durable package description. If the package still feels blurry after this section, the boundary story is not clear enough yet.

## In Scope

- document cleaning, normalization, and chunking
- ingest-local retrieval and indexing assembly
- package-local CLI and HTTP boundaries
- ingest-specific safeguards, adapters, and observability helpers

## Out of Scope

- runtime-wide replay authority and persistence
- cross-package vector execution semantics
- repository maintenance automation

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/src/bijux_canon_ingest` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/tests` as the package proof surface

## Open This Page When

- you need the package idea before the implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs here or in a neighboring package
- you want the shortest honest explanation of what this package is for

## Decision Rule

Use `Scope and Non-Goals` to decide whether a change makes `bijux-canon-ingest` easier or harder to defend as one distinct role in the overall system. If the work makes the package broader without making its role clearer, stop and re-check the boundary before treating the change as a local improvement.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- what problem `bijux-canon-ingest` owns on purpose
- where the package boundary stops, even when nearby code looks tempting
- which neighboring package seams deserve comparison before the boundary is changed

## Review Focus

- compare the stated boundary with the modules, artifacts, and tests that uphold it
- check that out-of-scope behavior is not quietly re-entering through convenience paths
- confirm that the package story still matches the real repository layout and neighboring package docs

## Limits

Code, tests, and neighboring package seams remain the proof of this boundary.
