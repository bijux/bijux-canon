# Integration Seams

Integration seams are the points where `bijux-canon-ingest` meets configuration, APIs,
operators, or neighboring packages.

This page exists so integration changes do not feel mysterious. A reviewer should
be able to say which seams are intentional, which ones carry compatibility risk,
and where the package expects outside systems to meet it.

Treat the architecture pages for `bijux-canon-ingest` as a reviewer-facing map of structure and flow. They should shorten code reading, not try to replace it.

## Integration Surfaces

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py
- HTTP boundaries under src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces
- configuration modules under src/bijux_canon_ingest/config

## Adjacent Systems

- feeds prepared material toward bijux-canon-index and bijux-canon-reason
- stays under runtime governance instead of defining replay authority itself

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/processing` for deterministic document transforms
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/retrieval` for retrieval-oriented models and assembly
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/application` for package workflows

## Open This Page When

- you are tracing structure, execution flow, or dependency pressure
- you need to understand how modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing design drift rather than one isolated bug

## Decision Rule

Use `Integration Seams` to decide whether a structural change makes `bijux-canon-ingest` easier or harder to explain in terms of modules, dependency direction, and execution flow. If the change works only because the design becomes harder to read, the safer answer is redesign rather than acceptance.

## What This Page Answers

- how `bijux-canon-ingest` is organized internally in terms a reviewer can follow
- which modules carry the main execution and dependency story
- where structural drift would show up before it becomes expensive

## Reviewer Lens

- trace the described execution path through the named modules instead of trusting the diagram alone
- look for dependency direction or layering that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that the structural risks named here still match the current code shape

## Honesty Boundary

This page describes the current structural model of `bijux-canon-ingest`, but it does not guarantee that every import path or runtime path still obeys that model. Readers should treat it as a map that must stay aligned with code and tests, not as an authority above them.

## Next Checks

- open interfaces when the review reaches a public or operator-facing seam
- open operations when the concern becomes repeatable runtime behavior
- open quality when you need proof that the documented structure is still protected
