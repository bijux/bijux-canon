# Invariants

Invariants are the promises that should survive ordinary implementation change.

This page names the truths the package is trying hardest not to lose. If an
invariant changes, that should feel more like a design event than a routine code
edit.

The quality pages show how trust is earned and where skepticism still belongs.

## Invariant Anchors

- package boundary stays explicit
- interface and artifact contracts remain reviewable
- tests continue to prove the long-lived promises

## Supporting Tests

- tests/unit for module-level behavior across processing, retrieval, and interfaces
- tests/e2e for package boundary coverage
- tests/invariants for long-lived repository promises
- tests/eval for corpus-backed behavior checks

## Concrete Anchors

- tests/unit for module-level behavior across processing, retrieval, and interfaces
- tests/e2e for package boundary coverage
- README.md

## Open This Page When

- you are reviewing tests, invariants, limitations, or ongoing risks
- you need evidence that the documented contract is actually defended
- you are deciding whether a change is truly done rather than merely implemented

## Decision Rule

Use `Invariants` to decide whether `bijux-canon-ingest` has actually earned trust after a change. If one narrow green check hides a wider contract, risk, or validation gap, the work is not done yet.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- what currently proves the `bijux-canon-ingest` contract instead of merely describing it
- which risks, limits, and assumptions still need explicit skepticism
- what a reviewer should be able to say before accepting a change as done

## Review Focus

- compare the documented proof story with the actual test layout and release posture
- look for limitations or risks that should have moved with recent behavior changes
- verify that the claimed done-ness standard still reflects real validation practice

## Limits

Tests, checks, and review practice remain the proof for this package. If they drift, this page is wrong.

## Read Next

- open foundation when the risk appears to be boundary confusion rather than missing tests
- open architecture when the proof gap points to structural drift
- open interfaces or operations when the proof question is really about a contract or workflow
