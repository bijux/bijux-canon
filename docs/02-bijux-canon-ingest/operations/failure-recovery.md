# Failure Recovery

Failure recovery starts with knowing which artifacts, interfaces, and tests expose the problem.

This page helps a maintainer stabilize the situation before trying to improve
it. The first question is not always how to fix the bug; it is how to locate
the right evidence quickly.

Treat the operations pages for `bijux-canon-ingest` as the package's explicit operating memory. They make common tasks repeatable without relearning the workflow from logs or oral history.

## Recovery Anchors

- interface surfaces: CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py, HTTP boundaries under src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces, configuration modules under src/bijux_canon_ingest/config
- artifacts to inspect: normalized document trees, chunk collections and retrieval-ready records, diagnostic output produced during ingest workflows
- tests to run: tests/unit for module-level behavior across processing, retrieval, and interfaces, tests/e2e for package boundary coverage

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Open This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need repeatable operational anchors rather than architectural framing
- you are responding to package behavior in local work, CI, or incident pressure

## Decision Rule

Use `Failure Recovery` to decide whether a maintainer can repeat the package workflow from checked-in assets instead of memory. If a step works only because someone already knows the trick, the workflow is not documented clearly enough yet.

## What This Page Answers

- how `bijux-canon-ingest` is installed, run, diagnosed, and released in practice
- which checked-in files and tests anchor the operational story
- where a maintainer should look first when the package behaves differently

## Reviewer Lens

- verify that setup, workflow, and release statements still match package metadata and current commands
- check that operational guidance still points at real diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that maintainer advice still works under current local and CI expectations

## Honesty Boundary

This page shows how `bijux-canon-ingest` is operated, but it does not replace
package metadata, actual runtime behavior, or validation in a real
environment. A workflow is only trustworthy if a maintainer can still repeat
it from the checked-in assets named here.

## Next Checks

- open interfaces when the operational path depends on a specific surface contract
- open quality when the question becomes whether the workflow is sufficiently proven
- move back to architecture when operational complexity suggests a structural problem

## Purpose

This page shows the durable frame readers can use to triage package failures.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package entrypoints and diagnostic outputs.
