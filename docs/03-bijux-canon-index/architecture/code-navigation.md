# Code Navigation

When you need to understand a change in `bijux-canon-index`, use this reading order:

This page is intentionally practical. Its purpose is to shorten the path from a
question in review to the files that actually explain the answer.

The architecture pages are a reviewer-facing map of structure and flow. They shorten code reading instead of replacing it.

## Reading Order

- start at the relevant interface or API module
- move into the owning application or domain module
- finish in the tests that protect the behavior

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_index/domain` for execution, provenance, and request semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_index/application` for workflow coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_index/infra` for backends, adapters, and runtime environment helpers
- `src/bijux_canon_index/interfaces` for CLI and operator-facing edges
- `src/bijux_canon_index/api` for HTTP application surfaces
- `src/bijux_canon_index/contracts` for stable contract definitions

## Test Anchors

- tests/unit for API, application, contracts, domain, infra, and tooling
- tests/e2e for CLI workflows, API smoke, determinism gates, and provenance gates
- tests/conformance and tests/compat_v01 for compatibility behavior
- tests/stress and tests/scenarios for operational pressure checks

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_index/domain` for execution, provenance, and request semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_index/application` for workflow coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_index/infra` for backends, adapters, and runtime environment helpers

## Open This Page When

- you are tracing structure, execution flow, or dependency pressure
- you need to understand how modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing design drift rather than one isolated bug

## Decision Rule

Use `Code Navigation` to decide whether a structural change makes `bijux-canon-index` easier or harder to explain in terms of modules, dependency direction, and execution flow. If the change works only because the design becomes harder to read, the safer answer is redesign rather than acceptance.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `bijux-canon-index` is organized internally in terms a reviewer can follow
- which modules carry the main execution and dependency story
- where structural drift would show up before it becomes expensive

## Review Focus

- trace the described execution path through the named modules instead of trusting the diagram alone
- look for dependency direction or layering that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that the structural risks named here still match the current code shape

## Limits

Treat this page as a working structural map and keep it aligned with code and tests.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the review reaches a public or operator-facing seam
- open operations when the concern becomes repeatable runtime behavior
- open quality when you need proof that the documented structure is still protected
