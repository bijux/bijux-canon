# Integration Seams

Integration seams are the points where `bijux-canon-index` meets configuration, APIs,
operators, or neighboring packages.

This page exists so integration changes do not feel mysterious. A reviewer should
be able to say which seams are intentional, which ones carry compatibility risk,
and where the package expects outside systems to meet it.

Treat the architecture pages for `bijux-canon-index` as a reviewer-facing map of structure and flow. They should shorten code reading, not try to replace it.

## Integration Surfaces

- CLI modules under src/bijux_canon_index/interfaces/cli
- HTTP app under src/bijux_canon_index/api
- OpenAPI schema files under apis/bijux-canon-index/v1

## Adjacent Systems

- consumes prepared inputs from ingest-oriented flows
- is governed by bijux-canon-runtime for final replay acceptance

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_index/domain` for execution, provenance, and request semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_index/application` for workflow coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_index/infra` for backends, adapters, and runtime environment helpers

## Open This Page When

- you are tracing structure, execution flow, or dependency pressure
- you need to understand how modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing design drift rather than one isolated bug

## Decision Rule

Use `Integration Seams` to decide whether a structural change makes `bijux-canon-index` easier or harder to explain in terms of modules, dependency direction, and execution flow. If the change works only because the design becomes harder to read, the safer answer is redesign rather than acceptance.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `bijux-canon-index` is organized internally in terms a reviewer can follow
- which modules carry the main execution and dependency story
- where structural drift would show up before it becomes expensive

## Review Focus

- trace the described execution path through the named modules instead of trusting the diagram alone
- look for dependency direction or layering that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that the structural risks named here still match the current code shape

## Limits

Treat this page as a working structural map and keep it aligned with code and tests.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the review reaches a public or operator-facing seam
- open operations when the concern becomes repeatable runtime behavior
- open quality when you need proof that the documented structure is still protected
