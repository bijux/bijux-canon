# Common Workflows

Most work on `bijux-canon-runtime` follows one of a few recurring paths.

This page makes those paths familiar and repeatable. Readers should not have
to rediscover the same workflow from scratch every time they debug, extend, or
review the package.

The operations pages make common tasks repeatable without relearning workflows from logs or oral history.

## Recurring Paths

- inspect the package README and section indexes first
- follow an interface into the owning module group
- run the owning tests before declaring the change complete

## Code Areas

- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/model` for durable runtime models
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/runtime` for execution engines and lifecycle logic
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/application` for orchestration and replay coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/verification` for runtime-level validation support
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces` for CLI surfaces and manifest loading
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/api` for HTTP application surfaces

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Open This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need repeatable operational anchors rather than architectural framing
- you are responding to package behavior in local work, CI, or incident pressure

## Decision Rule

Use `Common Workflows` to decide whether a maintainer can repeat the package workflow from checked-in assets instead of memory. If a step works only because someone already knows the trick, the workflow is not documented clearly enough yet.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `bijux-canon-runtime` is installed, run, diagnosed, and released in practice
- which checked-in files and tests anchor the operational story
- where a maintainer should look first when the package behaves differently

## Review Focus

- verify that setup, workflow, and release statements still match package metadata and current commands
- check that operational guidance still points at real diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that maintainer advice still works under current local and CI expectations

## Limits

Checked-in commands, artifacts, and validation remain the source of truth for this workflow.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the operational path depends on a specific surface contract
- open quality when the question becomes whether the workflow is sufficiently proven
- move back to architecture when operational complexity suggests a structural problem
