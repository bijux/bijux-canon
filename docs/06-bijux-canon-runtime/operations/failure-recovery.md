# Failure Recovery

Failure recovery starts with knowing which artifacts, interfaces, and tests expose the problem.

This page helps a maintainer stabilize the situation before trying to improve
it. The first question is not always how to fix the bug; it is how to locate
the right evidence quickly.

Treat the operations pages for `bijux-canon-runtime` as the package's explicit operating memory. They make common tasks repeatable without relearning the workflow from logs or oral history.

## Recovery Anchors

- interface surfaces: CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py, HTTP app in src/bijux_canon_runtime/api/v1, schema files in apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1
- artifacts to inspect: execution store records, replay decision artifacts, non-determinism policy evaluations
- tests to run: tests/unit for api, contracts, core, interfaces, model, and runtime, tests/e2e for governed flow behavior

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Open This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need repeatable operational anchors rather than architectural framing
- you are responding to package behavior in local work, CI, or incident pressure

## Decision Rule

Use `Failure Recovery` to decide whether a maintainer can repeat the package workflow from checked-in assets instead of memory. If a step works only because someone already knows the trick, the workflow is not documented clearly enough yet.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `bijux-canon-runtime` is installed, run, diagnosed, and released in practice
- which checked-in files and tests anchor the operational story
- where a maintainer should look first when the package behaves differently

## Review Focus

- verify that setup, workflow, and release statements still match package metadata and current commands
- check that operational guidance still points at real diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that maintainer advice still works under current local and CI expectations

## Limits

Checked-in commands, artifacts, and validation remain the source of truth for this workflow.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the operational path depends on a specific surface contract
- open quality when the question becomes whether the workflow is sufficiently proven
- move back to architecture when operational complexity suggests a structural problem
