# Module Map

The architecture of `bijux-canon-runtime` becomes readable when its major
module groups are treated as responsibilities instead of as folders. This page
helps a reviewer move from a question about behavior to the part of the
package most likely to answer it.

When this page is useful, code reading becomes targeted rather than exploratory.

This page is a reviewer-facing map of structure and flow. It shortens code
reading instead of trying to replace it.

## Major Modules

- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/model` for durable runtime models
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/runtime` for execution engines and lifecycle logic
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/application` for orchestration and replay coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/verification` for runtime-level validation support
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces` for CLI surfaces and manifest loading
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/api` for HTTP application surfaces

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/model` for durable runtime models
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/runtime` for execution engines and lifecycle logic
- `src/bijux_canon_runtime/application` for orchestration and replay coordination

## Open This Page When

- you are tracing structure, execution flow, or dependency pressure
- you need to understand how modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing design drift rather than one isolated bug

## Decision Rule

Use `Module Map` to decide whether a structural change makes `bijux-canon-runtime` easier or harder to explain in terms of modules, dependency direction, and execution flow. If the change works only because the design becomes harder to read, the safer answer is redesign rather than acceptance.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `bijux-canon-runtime` is organized internally in terms a reviewer can follow
- which modules carry the main execution and dependency story
- where structural drift would show up before it becomes expensive

## Review Focus

- trace the described execution path through the named modules instead of trusting the diagram alone
- look for dependency direction or layering that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that the structural risks named here still match the current code shape

## Limits

Treat this page as a working structural map and keep it aligned with code and tests.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the review reaches a public or operator-facing seam
- open operations when the concern becomes repeatable runtime behavior
- open quality when you need proof that the documented structure is still protected
