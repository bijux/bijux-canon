# Architecture Risks

Architectural risk appears when the package boundary becomes hard to explain or hard to test.

## Risk Signals

- behavior moves into the wrong package because it seems convenient
- interfaces start depending on lower-level implementation details directly
- produced artifacts stop matching their documented contract

## Review Areas

- `src/bijux_canon_index/domain` for execution, provenance, and request semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_index/application` for workflow coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_index/infra` for backends, adapters, and runtime environment helpers
- `src/bijux_canon_index/interfaces` for CLI and operator-facing edges
- `src/bijux_canon_index/api` for HTTP application surfaces
- `src/bijux_canon_index/contracts` for stable contract definitions

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_index/domain` for execution, provenance, and request semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_index/application` for workflow coordination
- `src/bijux_canon_index/infra` for backends, adapters, and runtime environment helpers

## Use This Page When

- you are tracing internal structure or execution flow
- you need to understand where modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing architectural drift instead of one local bug

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-index is structured internally
- which modules control the main execution path
- where architectural drift would become visible first

## Reviewer Lens

- trace the claimed execution path through the listed modules
- look for dependency direction that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that architectural risks still match the current code structure

## Honesty Boundary

This page describes the current structural model of bijux-canon-index, but it does not by itself prove that every import or runtime path still obeys that model.

## Purpose

This page keeps architectural review focused on durable package risks instead of transient churn.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package structure and known review concerns.

## Core Claim

The architectural claim of `bijux-canon-index` is that its structure is deliberate enough for a reviewer to trace responsibilities, dependencies, and drift pressure without reverse-engineering the entire codebase.

## Why It Matters

If the architecture pages for `bijux-canon-index` are weak, refactors become guesswork and dependency drift can hide until failures show up in tests or production-facing behavior.

## If It Drifts

- dependency direction becomes harder to inspect quickly
- refactors can land without anyone noticing structural regressions until later
- code navigation becomes slower because the documented map no longer matches reality
