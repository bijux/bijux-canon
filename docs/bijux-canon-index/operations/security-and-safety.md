## Review Anchors

- CLI modules under src/bijux_canon_index/interfaces/cli
- HTTP app under src/bijux_canon_index/api
- OpenAPI schema files under apis/bijux-canon-index/v1

## Safety Rule

Any change that broadens package authority should update docs, tests, and release notes together.

## Use This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need operational anchors rather than conceptual framing
- you are responding to package behavior in a local or CI environment

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-index is installed, run, diagnosed, and released
- which files or tests matter during package operation
- where an operator should look when behavior changes

## Purpose

This page keeps security review grounded in concrete package seams.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package interfaces and operational risk profile.
