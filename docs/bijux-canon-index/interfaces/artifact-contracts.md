# Artifact Contracts

Produced artifacts are part of the package contract whenever another package, operator,
or replay workflow depends on them.

## Current Artifacts

- vector execution result collections
- provenance and replay comparison reports
- backend-specific metadata and audit output

## Purpose

This page marks which outputs need stable review when behavior changes.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package outputs that are actually produced and consumed.
