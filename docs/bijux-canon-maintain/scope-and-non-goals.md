# Scope and Non-Goals

`bijux-canon-dev` is for maintainers and automation.

Its value depends on discipline. If maintainer code starts absorbing
product behavior, the repository loses one of its most important
boundaries: the difference between health tooling and product surface.

These maintainer pages should read like explicit operational memory for repository-health work. They are strongest when they expose automation intent, package impact, and repository policy without pretending that CI logs are documentation.

## In Scope

- CI-facing helpers
- quality, security, SBOM, release, and schema checks
- package-specific repository automation

## Out of Scope

- user-facing runtime behavior
- product-domain models that belong to canonical packages
- legacy-name compatibility shims

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-dev/src/bijux_canon_dev` for maintainer helpers
- `packages/bijux-canon-dev/tests` for executable maintenance proof
- `apis/` and root workflows for repository-level integration points

## Use This Page When

- you are changing repository automation, validation, or release support
- you need maintainer-only context that should not live in product package docs
- you are reviewing CI, schema drift, or supply-chain behavior

## Decision Rule

Use `Scope and Non-Goals` to decide whether a change belongs to maintainer automation or to a product package contract. If the change would affect end-user behavior directly, this page should push the review back toward the owning product package instead of letting maintainer scope sprawl.

## What This Page Answers

- which repository maintenance concern this page explains
- which maintainer modules or tests support that concern
- what a reviewer should confirm before changing repository automation

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the described maintainer behavior with the actual helper modules and tests
- check that maintainer-only guidance has not leaked into product-facing pages
- confirm that repository automation still names its package impact explicitly

## Next Checks

- move to product package docs if the question is user-facing behavior rather than repository health
- open the relevant helper module or test after using this page to orient yourself
- return to repository handbook pages when the maintainer issue turns out to be root policy instead

## Honesty Boundary

This section can describe maintainer automation and repository health work, but it should never imply that maintainer tooling is part of the end-user product surface. It also should not pretend that hidden scripts count as documentation just because CI happens to run them.

## Purpose

This page prevents maintenance code from becoming an unbounded dumping ground.

## Stability

Update this page only when ownership truly moves into or out of the maintenance package.
