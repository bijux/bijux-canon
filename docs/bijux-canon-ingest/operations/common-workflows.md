## Recurring Paths

- inspect the package README and section indexes first
- follow an interface into the owning module group
- run the owning tests before declaring the change complete

## Code Areas

- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/processing` for deterministic document transforms
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/retrieval` for retrieval-oriented models and assembly
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/application` for package workflows
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/infra` for local adapters and infrastructure helpers
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces` for CLI and HTTP boundaries
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/safeguards` for protective rules for ingest behavior

## Use This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need operational anchors rather than conceptual framing
- you are responding to package behavior in a local or CI environment

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-ingest is installed, run, diagnosed, and released
- which files or tests matter during package operation
- where an operator should look when behavior changes

## Purpose

This page makes common package workflows easier to repeat consistently.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the actual package structure and tests.
