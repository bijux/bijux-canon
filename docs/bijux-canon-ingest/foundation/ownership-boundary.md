# Ownership Boundary

Ownership in `bijux-canon-ingest` is easiest to read from the source tree plus the tests that protect it.

## Owned Code Areas

- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/processing` for deterministic document transforms
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/retrieval` for retrieval-oriented models and assembly
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/application` for package workflows
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/infra` for local adapters and infrastructure helpers
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces` for CLI and HTTP boundaries
- `src/bijux_canon_ingest/safeguards` for protective rules for ingest behavior

## Adjacent Systems

- feeds prepared material toward bijux-canon-index and bijux-canon-reason
- stays under runtime governance instead of defining replay authority itself

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/src/bijux_canon_ingest` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-canon-ingest/tests` as the package proof surface

## Use This Page When

- you need the package boundary before reading implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs in this package or a neighboring one
- you need the shortest stable description of package intent

## What This Page Answers

- what bijux-canon-ingest is expected to own
- what remains outside the package boundary
- which neighboring seams a reviewer should compare next

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the stated package boundary with the owned modules and tests
- check that out-of-scope work is not quietly reintroduced through adjacent packages
- confirm that the package description still matches the real repository layout

## Honesty Boundary

This page can explain the intended boundary of bijux-canon-ingest, but it does not replace the code and tests that ultimately prove that boundary.

## Purpose

This page ties package ownership to concrete directories instead of abstract slogans.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the current module layout.

## Core Claim

The foundational claim of `bijux-canon-ingest` is that its package boundary can be explained in stable ownership terms instead of by implementation accident.

## Why It Matters

If the foundation pages for `bijux-canon-ingest` are weak, reviewers stop knowing where the package boundary really is and adjacent packages begin absorbing behavior by convenience instead of design.
