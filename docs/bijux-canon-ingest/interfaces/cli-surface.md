## Command Facts

- canonical command: `bijux-canon-ingest`
- interface modules: CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py, HTTP boundaries under src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces, configuration modules under src/bijux_canon_ingest/config

## Concrete Anchors

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py
- HTTP boundaries under src/bijux_canon_ingest/interfaces
- configuration modules under src/bijux_canon_ingest/config
- apis/bijux-canon-ingest/v1/schema.yaml

## Use This Page When

- you need the public command, API, import, or artifact surface
- you are checking whether a caller can rely on a given shape or entrypoint
- you need the contract-facing side of the package before using it

## What This Page Answers

- which public or operator-facing surfaces bijux-canon-ingest exposes
- which artifacts and schemas act like contracts
- what compatibility pressure this surface creates

## Reviewer Lens

- compare commands, API files, imports, and artifacts against the documented surface
- check whether schema or artifact changes need compatibility review
- confirm that operator-facing examples still point at real entrypoints

## Honesty Boundary

This page can identify the intended public surfaces of bijux-canon-ingest, but real compatibility still depends on code, schemas, artifacts, and tests staying aligned.

## Purpose

This page points maintainers toward the command entrypoints and their owning code.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the declared scripts and the interface modules that implement them.

## Core Claim

The interface claim of `bijux-canon-ingest` is that commands, APIs, imports, schemas, and artifacts form a reviewable contract rather than an implied one.

## Why It Matters

If the interface pages for `bijux-canon-ingest` are weak, callers cannot tell which commands, schemas, or artifacts are stable enough to depend on, and compatibility review arrives too late.

## If It Drifts

- callers depend on surfaces that are less stable than the docs imply
- schema and artifact changes stop receiving the compatibility review they need
- operator examples begin pointing at stale or misleading entrypaths

## Representative Scenario

An operator or downstream caller wants to depend on a `bijux-canon-ingest` surface and needs to know which command, API, schema, import, or artifact is stable enough to treat as a contract.
