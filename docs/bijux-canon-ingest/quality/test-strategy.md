## Test Areas

- tests/unit for module-level behavior across processing, retrieval, and interfaces
- tests/e2e for package boundary coverage
- tests/invariants for long-lived repository promises
- tests/eval for corpus-backed behavior checks

## Concrete Anchors

- tests/unit for module-level behavior across processing, retrieval, and interfaces
- tests/e2e for package boundary coverage
- README.md

## Use This Page When

- you are reviewing tests, invariants, limitations, or risk
- you need evidence that the documented contract is actually protected
- you are deciding whether a change is done rather than merely implemented

## What This Page Answers

- what proves the bijux-canon-ingest contract today
- which risks or limits still need explicit review
- what a reviewer should verify before accepting change

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the documented proof strategy with the current test layout
- look for limitations or risks that should have been updated by recent changes
- verify that the page's definition of done still reflects real validation practice

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-ingest protects itself, but it does not claim that prose alone is enough without the listed tests, checks, and review practice.

## Purpose

This page explains the broad testing shape of the package.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the real test directories and the behaviors they protect.
