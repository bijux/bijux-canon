# Known Limitations

No package is improved by pretending its limitations do not exist.

## Honest Boundaries

- runtime-wide replay authority and persistence
- cross-package vector execution semantics
- repository maintenance automation

## Purpose

This page keeps limitation language attached to the package boundary instead of scattered through issue comments.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the limitations that remain intentionally true today.
