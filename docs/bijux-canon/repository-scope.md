# Repository Scope

The root repository owns only the concerns that are shared across packages or
that coordinate them as one releasable workspace.

## In Scope

- workspace-level build and test orchestration
- documentation, governance, and contributor-facing repository rules
- API schema storage and drift checks that involve multiple packages
- release tagging and versioning conventions shared across packages

## Out of Scope

- package-local domain behavior that belongs inside a package handbook
- hidden root logic that bypasses package APIs
- undocumented exceptions to the published package boundaries

## Concrete Anchors

- `pyproject.toml` for workspace metadata and commit conventions
- `Makefile` and `makes/` for root automation
- `apis/` and `.github/workflows/` for schema and validation review

## Use This Page When

- you are dealing with repository-wide seams rather than one package alone
- you need shared workflow, schema, or governance context before changing code
- you want the monorepo view that sits above the package handbooks

## What This Page Answers

- which repository-level decision this page clarifies
- which shared assets or workflows a reviewer should inspect
- how the repository boundary differs from package-local ownership

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the page claims with the real root files, workflows, or schema assets
- check that repository guidance still stops where package ownership begins
- confirm that any repository rule described here is still enforceable in code or automation

## Honesty Boundary

These pages explain repository-level intent and shared rules, but they do not override package-local ownership or serve as evidence without the referenced files, workflows, and checks.

## Purpose

This page keeps the repository from becoming a vague catch-all layer above the packages.

## Stability

Update this page only when ownership truly moves between the repository and one of the packages.

## Core Claim

Each repository handbook page should make one monorepo-level decision legible enough that package-local pages do not need to reinvent root context.

## Why It Matters

Repository pages matter because they keep shared rules, schemas, workflows, and release expectations from being rediscovered separately inside each package.
