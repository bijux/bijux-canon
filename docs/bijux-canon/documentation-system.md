# Documentation System

The root documentation site is the canonical handbook for repository and
package behavior. It is intentionally structured like the reference documentation
in `bijux-pollenomics` and `bijux-masterclass`: one root index, section indexes,
and topic pages with stable names and repeated layout.

## Page Maps

## Documentation Rules

- use stable filenames that describe durable intent
- keep package handbooks on the same five-category spine
- separate product docs, maintainer docs, and legacy-compat docs
- update docs in the same change series that changes the underlying behavior

## Concrete Anchors

- `pyproject.toml` for workspace metadata and commit conventions
- `Makefile` and `makes/` for root automation
- `apis/` and `.github/workflows/` for schema and validation review

## Use This Page When

- you are dealing with repository-wide seams rather than one package alone
- you need shared workflow, schema, or governance context before changing code
- you want the monorepo view that sits above the package handbooks

## What This Page Answers

- which repository-level decision this page clarifies
- which shared assets or workflows a reviewer should inspect
- how the repository boundary differs from package-local ownership

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the page claims with the real root files, workflows, or schema assets
- check that repository guidance still stops where package ownership begins
- confirm that any repository rule described here is still enforceable in code or automation

## Honesty Boundary

These pages explain repository-level intent and shared rules, but they do not override package-local ownership or serve as evidence without the referenced files, workflows, and checks.

## Purpose

This page records the handbook system itself so the structure stays intentional instead of growing ad hoc again.

## Stability

Keep this page aligned with the actual docs tree and the layout rules enforced by this documentation catalog.
