# Local Development

Local work should happen through the publishable packages plus the root
orchestration commands that keep the repository consistent. The goal is not to
make every task happen at the root; it is to make cross-package work visible
when it truly becomes cross-package.

## Visual Summary

## Working Rules

- make package-local changes in the owning package directory
- use root automation when the change spans packages, schemas, or docs
- keep documentation updates reviewable alongside the code that changes behavior

## Shared Inputs

- `pyproject.toml` for uv workspace metadata and commit conventions
- `tox.ini` for root validation environments
- `Makefile` and `makes/` for common workflows

## Concrete Anchors

- `pyproject.toml` for workspace metadata and commit conventions
- `Makefile` and `makes/` for root automation
- `apis/` and `.github/workflows/` for schema and validation review

## Open This Page When

- you are dealing with repository-wide seams rather than one package alone
- you need shared workflow, schema, or governance context before changing code
- you want the monorepo view that sits above the package handbooks

## Decision Rule

Open this page when local work spans packages, schemas, or root automation. If
the question stays inside one package's local setup or behavior, open that
package handbook instead.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- which repository-wide development posture is expected
- which shared files support local cross-package work
- how root orchestration differs from package-local setup

## Review Focus

- compare the page claims with the real root files, workflows, or schema assets
- check that repository guidance still stops where package ownership begins
- confirm that any repository rule described here is still enforceable in code or automation

## Limits

Repository guidance here does not replace package-local setup instructions or
checks. The real backstops are the referenced root files, workflows, schemas,
and package handbooks.

## Read Next

- open the owning package docs when the question stops being repository-wide
- check root files, schemas, or workflows named here before trusting prose alone
- use the maintainer handbook at `https://bijux.io/bijux-canon/07-bijux-canon-maintain/`
  when the issue is really about automation or drift tooling
