# Workspace Layout

The repository layout is intentionally direct so maintainers can see where a
concern belongs before they open any code. The directory tree is part of the
design language: it should reinforce the package split instead of making it
harder to see.

## Top-Level Directories

- `packages/` for publishable Python distributions
- `apis/` for shared schema sources and pinned artifacts
- `docs/` for the canonical handbook
- `makes/` and `Makefile` for workspace automation
- `artifacts/` for generated or checked validation outputs
- `configs/` for root-managed tool configuration

## Layout Rule

A concern should live at the root only when it serves more than one package or
when it is about the workspace itself.

## Concrete Anchors

- `pyproject.toml` for workspace metadata and commit conventions
- `Makefile` and `makes/` for root automation
- `apis/` and `.github/workflows/` for schema and validation review

## Open This Page When

- you are dealing with repository-wide seams rather than one package alone
- you need shared workflow, schema, or governance context before changing code
- you want the monorepo view that sits above the package handbooks

## Decision Rule

Use this page when the main question is where a repository concern lives in the
tree. If the answer depends mostly on one package's internal layout, open
that package handbook instead.

## What This Page Answers

- which top-level directories carry which kinds of repository concern
- which shared assets deserve inspection for root-level work
- how root layout differs from package-local ownership

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the page claims with the real root files, workflows, or schema assets
- check that repository guidance still stops where package ownership begins
- confirm that any repository rule described here is still enforceable in code or automation

## Honesty Boundary

This page maps the repository tree, but code, schemas, workflows, and package
handbooks still define the detailed behavior inside each area.

## Next Checks

- open the owning package docs when the question stops being repository-wide
- check root files, schemas, or workflows named here before trusting prose alone
- use the maintainer handbook at `https://bijux.io/bijux-canon/07-bijux-canon-maintain/`
  when the issue is really about automation or drift tooling
