# Failure Recovery

Failure recovery starts with knowing which artifacts, interfaces, and tests expose the problem.

```

## Recovery Anchors

- interface surfaces: CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py, HTTP app in src/bijux_canon_runtime/api/v1, schema files in apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1
- artifacts to inspect: execution store records, replay decision artifacts, non-determinism policy evaluations
- tests to run: tests/unit for api, contracts, core, interfaces, model, and runtime, tests/e2e for governed flow behavior

## Purpose

This page gives maintainers a durable frame for triaging package failures.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package entrypoints and diagnostic outputs.
