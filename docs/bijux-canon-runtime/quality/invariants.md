# Invariants

Invariants are the promises that should survive ordinary implementation change.

## Page Maps

## Invariant Anchors

- package boundary stays explicit
- interface and artifact contracts remain reviewable
- tests continue to prove the long-lived promises

## Supporting Tests

- tests/unit for api, contracts, core, interfaces, model, and runtime
- tests/e2e for governed flow behavior
- tests/regression and tests/smoke for replay and storage protection
- tests/golden for durable example fixtures

## Purpose

This page records the kinds of promises that should not drift casually.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with invariant-focused tests and documented package guarantees.
