# Change Validation

Validation after a change should target the package surfaces that were actually touched.

## Page Maps

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    scope["bijux-canon-runtime"] --> section["Quality"]
    section --> page["Change Validation"]
    dest1["reviewable boundaries"]
    dest2["operator clarity"]
    dest3["change safety"]
    page --> dest1
    page --> dest2
    page --> dest3
```

## Validation Targets

- interface changes should update interface docs and owning tests
- artifact changes should update artifact docs and consuming tests
- architectural changes should update section pages that explain the package seam

## Test Anchors

- tests/unit for api, contracts, core, interfaces, model, and runtime
- tests/e2e for governed flow behavior
- tests/regression and tests/smoke for replay and storage protection
- tests/golden for durable example fixtures

## Purpose

This page records how to choose meaningful validation for package work.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package's current test layout and docs structure.
