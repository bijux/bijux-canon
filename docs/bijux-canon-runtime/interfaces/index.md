# Interfaces

bijux-canon-runtime interface pages describe the command, API, configuration, import, and artifact surfaces that a caller can rely on.

Read the interfaces pages for `bijux-canon-runtime` as the bridge between implementation and caller expectations: they should make public surfaces legible before a downstream dependency is formed.

- [Foundation](../foundation/index.md)
- [Architecture](../architecture/index.md)
- [Operations](../operations/index.md)
- [Quality](../quality/index.md)

## Concrete Anchors

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py
- HTTP app in src/bijux_canon_runtime/api/v1
- schema files in apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1
- apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1/schema.yaml

## Use This Page When

- you need the public command, API, import, or artifact surface
- you are checking whether a caller can rely on a given shape or entrypoint
- you need the contract-facing side of the package before using it

## Decision Rule

Use `Interfaces` to decide whether a caller-facing surface is explicit enough to be depended on. If the surface cannot be tied back to concrete code, schemas, artifacts, and tests, it should be treated as unstable until that evidence exists.

## Next Checks

- move to operations when the caller-facing question becomes procedural or environmental
- move to quality when compatibility or evidence of protection becomes the real issue
- move back to architecture when a public-surface question reveals a deeper structural drift

## Update This Page When

- commands, schemas, API modules, imports, or artifacts change in a caller-visible way
- compatibility expectations change or a new contract surface appears
- examples or entrypoints stop matching the actual package boundary

## What This Page Answers

- which public or operator-facing surfaces bijux-canon-runtime exposes
- which artifacts and schemas act like contracts
- what compatibility pressure this surface creates

## Reviewer Lens

- compare commands, API files, imports, and artifacts against the documented surface
- check whether schema or artifact changes need compatibility review
- confirm that operator-facing examples still point at real entrypoints

## Honesty Boundary

This page can identify the intended public surfaces of bijux-canon-runtime, but real compatibility still depends on code, schemas, artifacts, and tests staying aligned.

## Section Contract

- define what the interfaces section covers for bijux-canon-runtime
- point readers to the topic pages that hold the detailed explanations
- keep the section boundary reviewable as the package evolves

## Reading Advice

- start here when you know the package but not yet the right page inside the section
- use the page list to choose the narrowest topic that matches the current question
- move across sections only after this section stops being the right lens

## Purpose

This page explains how to use the interfaces section for `bijux-canon-runtime` without repeating the detail that belongs on the topic pages beneath it.

## Stability

This page is part of the canonical package docs spine. Keep it aligned with the current package boundary and the topic pages in this section.

## What Good Looks Like

- `Interfaces` leaves a caller knowing which surfaces are explicit enough to trust
- the contract discussion ties together commands, schemas, artifacts, and tests instead of treating them separately
- compatibility review becomes a visible step rather than an afterthought

## Failure Signals

- `Interfaces` names surfaces that cannot be matched to real code, schemas, or artifacts
- callers have to infer stability from examples instead of from explicit contract evidence
- compatibility review starts after change has already landed instead of before

## Cross Implications

- changes here shape what downstream packages and operators can safely assume about `bijux-canon-runtime`
- operations and quality pages become stale quickly if contract surfaces move silently
- architectural seams need review whenever a new public surface appears for convenience

## Evidence Checklist

- inspect the implemented interface modules under `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/src/bijux_canon_runtime`
- review `apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1/schema.yaml` as tracked contract evidence
- run through `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` or equivalent proofs that protect the surface

## Core Claim

The interface claim of `bijux-canon-runtime` is that commands, APIs, imports, schemas, and artifacts form a reviewable contract rather than an implied one.

## Why It Matters

If the interface pages for `bijux-canon-runtime` are weak, callers cannot tell which commands, schemas, or artifacts are stable enough to depend on, and compatibility review arrives too late.

## If It Drifts

- callers depend on surfaces that are less stable than the docs imply
- schema and artifact changes stop receiving the compatibility review they need
- operator examples begin pointing at stale or misleading entrypaths

## Representative Scenario

An operator or downstream caller wants to depend on a `bijux-canon-runtime` surface and needs to know which command, API, schema, import, or artifact is stable enough to treat as a contract.

## Source Of Truth Order

- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/src/bijux_canon_runtime` for the implemented boundary
- `apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1/schema.yaml` as tracked contract evidence
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` for compatibility and behavior proof

## Common Misreadings

- that every visible package surface is equally stable
- that one schema or example is the whole compatibility story
- that interface docs override package code, artifacts, or tests when they disagree
