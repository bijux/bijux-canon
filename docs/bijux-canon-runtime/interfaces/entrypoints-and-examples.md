# Entrypoints and Examples

The fastest way to understand the package interfaces is to pair entrypoints with concrete examples.

## Entrypoints

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py
- HTTP app in src/bijux_canon_runtime/api/v1
- schema files in apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1

## Example Anchors

- examples/ for minimal flows, replay violations, and datasets
- apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1/schema.hash for schema integrity checks

## Concrete Anchors

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_runtime/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py
- HTTP app in src/bijux_canon_runtime/api/v1
- schema files in apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1
- apis/bijux-canon-runtime/v1/schema.yaml

## Use This Page When

- you need the public command, API, import, or artifact surface
- you are checking whether a caller can rely on a given shape or entrypoint
- you need the contract-facing side of the package before using it

## What This Page Answers

- which public or operator-facing surfaces bijux-canon-runtime exposes
- which artifacts and schemas act like contracts
- what compatibility pressure this surface creates

## Reviewer Lens

- compare commands, API files, imports, and artifacts against the documented surface
- check whether schema or artifact changes need compatibility review
- confirm that operator-facing examples still point at real entrypoints

## Honesty Boundary

This page can identify the intended public surfaces of bijux-canon-runtime, but real compatibility still depends on code, schemas, artifacts, and tests staying aligned.

## Purpose

This page records where maintainers can find real invocation examples instead of inventing them from scratch.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the checked-in examples, fixtures, and executable tests.
