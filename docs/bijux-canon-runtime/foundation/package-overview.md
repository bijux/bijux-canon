# Package Overview

`bijux-canon-runtime` exists so one durable part of the system can stay legible.
Its job is to own governed execution and replay authority with auditable non-determinism handling, persistence, and package-to-package coordination.

If a reader cannot explain this package in one or two sentences after skimming
this page, the package boundary is still too fuzzy and later pages will inherit
that confusion.

Read the foundation pages for `bijux-canon-runtime` as the package's durable self-description. They should let a reader understand the package without needing to reconstruct its purpose from recent implementation history.

## What It Owns

- flow execution authority
- replay and acceptability semantics
- trace capture, runtime persistence, and execution-store behavior
- package-local CLI and API boundaries

## What It Does Not Own

- agent composition policy
- ingest and index domain ownership
- repository tooling and release support

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/src/bijux_canon_runtime` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` as the package proof surface

## Use This Page When

- you need the package idea before the implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs here or in a neighboring package
- you want the shortest honest explanation of what this package is for

## Decision Rule

Use `Package Overview` to decide whether a change makes `bijux-canon-runtime` easier or harder to defend as a bounded package. If the work expands package authority without making ownership clearer, stop and re-check the boundary before treating the change as a local improvement.

## Next Checks

- move to architecture when the question becomes structural rather than boundary-oriented
- move to interfaces when the question becomes contract-facing
- move to quality when the question becomes proof or review sufficiency

## Update This Page When

- package ownership moves between this package and a neighboring one
- the package description, core outputs, or boundary modules materially change
- tests or docs reveal that the old boundary explanation is no longer accurate

## What This Page Answers

- what problem `bijux-canon-runtime` is supposed to own on purpose
- where the package boundary stops, even when nearby code looks tempting
- which neighboring package seams deserve comparison before the boundary is changed

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the stated boundary with the modules, artifacts, and tests that are supposed to uphold it
- check that out-of-scope behavior is not quietly re-entering through convenience paths
- confirm that the package story still matches the real repository layout and neighboring package docs

## Honesty Boundary

This page can explain the intended boundary of `bijux-canon-runtime`, but it cannot prove that boundary by itself. The real proof still lives in the code, tests, and neighboring package seams that either support or contradict the story told here.

## Purpose

This page gives the shortest honest description of what the package is for.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the real package boundary described by the code and tests.

## What Good Looks Like

- `Package Overview` leaves a reviewer able to explain `bijux-canon-runtime` in one boundary sentence without hand-waving
- the owned and out-of-scope areas read as complementary rather than contradictory
- neighboring packages become easier to place because this package is clearly bounded

## Failure Signals

- `Package Overview` has to explain the same ownership claim with repeated exceptions
- the out-of-scope list starts looking like shadow ownership instead of a real boundary
- review conversations keep falling back to package adjacency rather than package intent

## Tradeoffs To Hold

- prefer clean ownership over local convenience, even when nearby code looks easier to reuse
- prefer an explicit boundary gap over a shadow responsibility that no package clearly owns
- prefer keeping `bijux-canon-runtime` intelligible as a bounded package over making it look universally useful

## Cross Implications

- changes here influence how neighboring packages are allowed to stay narrow around `bijux-canon-runtime`
- a weak boundary explanation raises architectural and quality ambiguity immediately
- interface and operations pages inherit confusion when foundational ownership is unclear

## Approval Questions

- does `Package Overview` still let a reviewer state `bijux-canon-runtime` ownership in one clear sentence
- does the change preserve package boundaries without creating shadow scope in a neighbor
- is there concrete code and test evidence behind the boundary claim, or only persuasive prose

## Evidence Checklist

- read the owned module roots under `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/src/bijux_canon_runtime` with the boundary statement in mind
- inspect `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` for proof that the boundary is enforced instead of merely described
- check whether adjacent package docs now tell a conflicting ownership story

## Anti-Patterns

- using package adjacency as a substitute for package ownership
- letting boundary exceptions accumulate until they become the real rule
- writing boundary prose that cannot be checked against code or tests

## Escalate When

- the page can no longer explain ownership without repeated cross-package caveats
- a change proposal would shift authority between packages rather than stay local
- tests and docs disagree on who is supposed to own the behavior

## Core Claim

The core foundational claim of `bijux-canon-runtime` is that its ownership can be explained as a deliberate package boundary, not as an accident of where code happened to accumulate.

## Why It Matters

If the foundation pages for `bijux-canon-runtime` are weak, reviewers stop knowing where the package really begins and ends. Adjacent packages then absorb behavior by convenience instead of by design.

## If It Drifts

- ownership starts migrating by convenience instead of by explicit package boundary
- neighboring packages inherit responsibilities without deliberate review
- reviewers lose confidence that the package description still means anything stable

## Representative Scenario

A contributor proposes moving new behavior into `bijux-canon-runtime` because it is nearby in the repository. This page should make it obvious whether that work fits the package boundary or belongs in a neighboring package instead.

## Source Of Truth Order

- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/src/bijux_canon_runtime` for the real ownership boundary in code
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/tests` for executable proof that the boundary still holds under change
- `packages/bijux-canon-runtime/README.md` plus this section for the shortest maintained explanation of that boundary

## Common Misreadings

- that `bijux-canon-runtime` owns any nearby behavior just because it would be convenient
- that a boundary statement is enough even when code and tests tell a different story
- that out-of-scope means unimportant rather than intentionally owned elsewhere
