# Documentation Standards

Package docs should stay consistent with the shared handbook layout used across the repository.

## Standards

- use the shared five-category package spine
- prefer stable filenames that describe durable intent
- keep docs grounded in real code paths, interfaces, and artifacts

## Concrete Anchors

- tests/unit for local behavior and utility coverage
- tests/integration and tests/e2e for end-to-end workflow behavior
- README.md

## Use This Page When

- you are reviewing tests, invariants, limitations, or risk
- you need evidence that the documented contract is actually protected
- you are deciding whether a change is done rather than merely implemented

## What This Page Answers

- what proves the bijux-canon-agent contract today
- which risks or limits still need explicit review
- what a reviewer should verify before accepting change

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the documented proof strategy with the current test layout
- look for limitations or risks that should have been updated by recent changes
- verify that the page's definition of done still reflects real validation practice

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-agent protects itself, but it does not claim that prose alone is enough without the listed tests, checks, and review practice.

## Purpose

This page keeps package docs from drifting back into ad hoc structure.

## Stability

Update it only when the shared documentation system itself changes.
