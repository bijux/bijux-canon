# Known Limitations

No package is improved by pretending its limitations do not exist.

This page protects credibility by keeping the current limits visible. Readers
should be able to tell what the package does not promise without mining issue
threads or learning the hard way in production.

Read the quality pages for `bijux-canon-agent` as the proof frame around the package. They should explain how trust is earned, how risk stays visible, and why a passing local check is not always enough.

## Honest Boundaries

- runtime-wide persistence and replay acceptance
- ingest and index domain ownership
- repository tooling and release automation

## Concrete Anchors

- tests/unit for local behavior and utility coverage
- tests/integration and tests/e2e for end-to-end workflow behavior
- README.md

## Use This Page When

- you are reviewing tests, invariants, limitations, or ongoing risks
- you need evidence that the documented contract is actually defended
- you are deciding whether a change is truly done rather than merely implemented

## Decision Rule

Use `Known Limitations` to decide whether `bijux-canon-agent` has actually earned trust after a change. If one narrow green check hides a wider contract, risk, or validation gap, the work is not done yet.

## Next Checks

- move to foundation when the risk appears to be boundary confusion rather than missing tests
- move to architecture when the proof gap points to structural drift
- move to interfaces or operations when the proof question is really about a contract or workflow

## Update This Page When

- test layout, invariant protection, or risk posture changes materially
- definition-of-done or validation practice changes in a way reviewers must understand
- known limitations or evidence expectations move with the codebase

## What This Page Answers

- what currently proves the `bijux-canon-agent` contract instead of merely describing it
- which risks, limits, and assumptions still need explicit skepticism
- what a reviewer should be able to say before accepting a change as done

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the documented proof story with the actual test layout and release posture
- look for limitations or risks that should have moved with recent behavior changes
- verify that the claimed done-ness standard still reflects real validation practice

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-agent protects itself, but it does not claim that prose alone is enough without the listed tests, checks, and review practice.

## Purpose

This page keeps limitation language attached to the package boundary instead of scattered through issue comments.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the limitations that remain intentionally true today.

## What Good Looks Like

- `Known Limitations` leaves a reviewer able to say why the package should be trusted after a change
- tests, limitations, and risk language reinforce one another instead of competing
- the completion bar is demanding enough to prevent shallow acceptance

## Failure Signals

- `Known Limitations` says the package is protected but cannot show which proof closes which risk
- reviewers disagree on whether the work is done because the standard is too implicit
- limitations remain unchanged even when package behavior has obviously shifted

## Tradeoffs To Hold

- prefer broader proof over narrower green checks when the package contract is larger than one code path
- prefer visible limitations over a cleaner story that hides risk
- prefer a slightly slower approval path over granting `bijux-canon-agent` trust without enough evidence

## Cross Implications

- changes here influence how all other `bijux-canon-agent` sections should be trusted after modification
- foundation, architecture, interface, and operations claims all become weaker if proof expectations drift
- review discipline here determines whether neighboring sections remain explanatory or merely aspirational

## Approval Questions

- does `Known Limitations` show enough proof to trust `bijux-canon-agent` after change
- have limitations and known risks moved with the code rather than staying stale
- does the acceptance bar protect the package contract instead of only one local behavior

## Evidence Checklist

- read `packages/bijux-canon-agent/tests` with the page's proof claims in hand
- verify package metadata and release notes in `packages/bijux-canon-agent` do not contradict the review standard
- check whether known limitations, risks, and completion language all moved together in the current change

## Anti-Patterns

- equating one local pass with full contract confidence
- keeping old risk prose after the code and tests have materially changed
- treating definition-of-done language as ceremonial rather than operational

## Escalate When

- the proof story can no longer be updated without revisiting adjacent sections
- a local validation gap reveals a larger boundary or architecture issue
- reviewers cannot agree on done-ness because the underlying contract changed

## Core Claim

The quality claim of `bijux-canon-agent` is that tests, invariants, risks, and completion criteria jointly prove whether the package is trustworthy after change.

## Why It Matters

If the quality pages for `bijux-canon-agent` are weak, it becomes difficult to tell whether a change is actually safe or merely passes a narrow local test.

## If It Drifts

- reviewers cannot tell whether the listed proof still covers the real risk surface
- limitations stop being visible until they show up as rework later
- definition-of-done language drifts away from actual validation practice

## Representative Scenario

A change appears correct locally, but the reviewer still needs to know whether `bijux-canon-agent` has actually satisfied its proof obligations before the work is accepted.

## Source Of Truth Order

- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/tests` for executable proof
- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/pyproject.toml` for declared package constraints
- this page for the review lens that explains how to read that proof

## Common Misreadings

- that a passing local test automatically satisfies the package review standard
- that documented risks are static and do not need to move with the code
- that the definition of done is only about implementation rather than proof
