# Capability Map

The package capabilities can be read as a map from modules to behavior.

## Capability Map

- `src/bijux_canon_agent/agents` for role-local behavior
- `src/bijux_canon_agent/pipeline` for execution flow orchestration
- `src/bijux_canon_agent/application` for workflow policy and graph logic
- `src/bijux_canon_agent/llm` for LLM runtime integration support
- `src/bijux_canon_agent/interfaces` for CLI boundaries and operator helpers
- `src/bijux_canon_agent/traces` for trace-facing models and persistence helpers

## Produced Artifacts

- trace-backed final outputs
- workflow graph execution records
- operator-visible result artifacts

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-agent` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/src/bijux_canon_agent` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/tests` as the package proof surface

## Use This Page When

- you need the package boundary before reading implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs in this package or a neighboring one
- you need the shortest stable description of package intent

## What This Page Answers

- what bijux-canon-agent is expected to own
- what remains outside the package boundary
- which neighboring seams a reviewer should compare next

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the stated package boundary with the owned modules and tests
- check that out-of-scope work is not quietly reintroduced through adjacent packages
- confirm that the package description still matches the real repository layout

## Honesty Boundary

This page can explain the intended boundary of bijux-canon-agent, but it does not replace the code and tests that ultimately prove that boundary.

## Purpose

This page helps a reader quickly map package claims to code areas.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the real package modules and generated outputs.

## Core Claim

The foundational claim of `bijux-canon-agent` is that its package boundary can be explained in stable ownership terms instead of by implementation accident.

## Why It Matters

If the foundation pages for `bijux-canon-agent` are weak, reviewers stop knowing where the package boundary really is and adjacent packages begin absorbing behavior by convenience instead of design.
