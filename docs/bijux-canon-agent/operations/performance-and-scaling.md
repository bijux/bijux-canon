# Performance and Scaling

Performance work should preserve the deterministic and contract-driven behavior the package already promises.

## Page Maps

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    scope["bijux-canon-agent"] --> section["Operations"]
    section --> page["Performance and Scaling"]
    dest1["reviewable boundaries"]
    dest2["operator clarity"]
    dest3["change safety"]
    page --> dest1
    page --> dest2

```

## Performance Review Anchors

- inspect workflow modules before optimizing boundary code blindly
- use the package tests that exercise realistic workloads
- treat artifact and contract drift as a regression even when performance improves

## Test Anchors

- tests/unit for local behavior and utility coverage
- tests/integration and tests/e2e for end-to-end workflow behavior
- tests/invariants for package promises that should not drift
- tests/api for HTTP-facing validation

## Purpose

This page records the posture for performance work in `bijux-canon-agent`.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package's actual performance-sensitive paths and validation surfaces.
