# Deployment Boundaries

Deployment for `bijux-canon-agent` should respect the package boundary instead of assuming the full repository is always present.

## Boundary Facts

- package root: `packages/bijux-canon-agent`
- public metadata: `packages/bijux-canon-agent/pyproject.toml`
- release notes: `packages/bijux-canon-agent/CHANGELOG.md` when present

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-canon-agent/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Use This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need operational anchors rather than conceptual framing
- you are responding to package behavior in a local or CI environment

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-agent is installed, run, diagnosed, and released
- which files or tests matter during package operation
- where an operator should look when behavior changes

## Reviewer Lens

- verify that setup, workflow, and release references still match package metadata
- check that operational docs point at current diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that release-facing claims match the package's actual versioning files

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-agent is expected to be operated, but it does not replace package metadata, runtime behavior, or validation runs in a real environment.

## Purpose

This page reminds maintainers that packages are publishable units, not just folders in one repo.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package's actual distributable surface.
