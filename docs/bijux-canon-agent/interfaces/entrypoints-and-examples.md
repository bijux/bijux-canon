# Entrypoints and Examples

The fastest way to understand the package interfaces is to pair entrypoints with concrete examples.

## Entrypoints

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_canon_agent/interfaces/cli/entrypoint.py
- operator configuration under src/bijux_canon_agent/config
- HTTP-adjacent modules under src/bijux_canon_agent/api

## Example Anchors

- tests/e2e and tests/fixtures as executable examples
- config/execution_policy.yaml as a concrete policy surface

## Use This Page When

- you need the public command, API, import, or artifact surface
- you are checking whether a caller can rely on a given shape or entrypoint
- you need the contract-facing side of the package before using it

## What This Page Answers

- which public or operator-facing surfaces bijux-canon-agent exposes
- which artifacts and schemas act like contracts
- what compatibility pressure this surface creates

## Reviewer Lens

- compare commands, API files, imports, and artifacts against the documented surface
- check whether schema or artifact changes need compatibility review
- confirm that operator-facing examples still point at real entrypoints

## Purpose

This page records where maintainers can find real invocation examples instead of inventing them from scratch.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the checked-in examples, fixtures, and executable tests.
