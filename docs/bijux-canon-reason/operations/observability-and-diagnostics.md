# Observability and Diagnostics

Diagnostics should make it easier to explain what `bijux-canon-reason` did, not merely that it ran.

## Diagnostic Anchors

- reasoning traces and replay diffs
- claim and verification outcomes
- evaluation suite artifacts

## Supporting Modules

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/traces` for trace replay and diff support

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-reason/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-canon-reason/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-canon-reason/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Use This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need operational anchors rather than conceptual framing
- you are responding to package behavior in a local or CI environment

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-reason is installed, run, diagnosed, and released
- which files or tests matter during package operation
- where an operator should look when behavior changes

## Reviewer Lens

- verify that setup, workflow, and release references still match package metadata
- check that operational docs point at current diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that release-facing claims match the package's actual versioning files

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-reason is expected to be operated, but it does not replace package metadata, runtime behavior, or validation runs in a real environment.

## Purpose

This page points readers toward the package's observable output and diagnostic support.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package modules and artifacts that currently support diagnosis.
