Most work on `bijux-canon-reason` follows one of a few recurring paths.

## Recurring Paths

- inspect the package README and section indexes first
- follow an interface into the owning module group
- run the owning tests before declaring the change complete

## Code Areas

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/planning` for plan construction and intermediate representation
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning` for claim and reasoning semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/execution` for step execution and tool dispatch
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/verification` for checks and validation outcomes
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/traces` for trace replay and diff support
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/interfaces` for CLI and serialization boundaries

## Use This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need operational anchors rather than conceptual framing
- you are responding to package behavior in a local or CI environment

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-reason is installed, run, diagnosed, and released
- which files or tests matter during package operation
- where an operator should look when behavior changes

## Reviewer Lens

- verify that setup, workflow, and release references still match package metadata
- check that operational docs point at current diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that release-facing claims match the package's actual versioning files

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-reason is expected to be operated, but it does not replace package metadata, runtime behavior, or validation runs in a real environment.

## Purpose

This page makes common package workflows easier to repeat consistently.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the actual package structure and tests.
