# Common Workflows

Most work on `bijux-canon-reason` follows one of a few recurring paths.

This page should make those paths feel familiar and repeatable. Readers should
not have to rediscover the same workflow from scratch every time they debug,
extend, or review the package.

Read the operations pages for `bijux-canon-reason` as the package's explicit operating memory. They should make common tasks repeatable without forcing maintainers to relearn the workflow from code, CI logs, or oral history.

## Recurring Paths

- inspect the package README and section indexes first
- follow an interface into the owning module group
- run the owning tests before declaring the change complete

## Code Areas

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/planning` for plan construction and intermediate representation
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning` for claim and reasoning semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/execution` for step execution and tool dispatch
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/verification` for checks and validation outcomes
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/traces` for trace replay and diff support
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/interfaces` for CLI and serialization boundaries

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-reason/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-canon-reason/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-canon-reason/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Use This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need repeatable operational anchors rather than architectural framing
- you are responding to package behavior in local work, CI, or incident pressure

## Decision Rule

Use `Common Workflows` to decide whether a maintainer can repeat the package workflow from checked-in assets instead of memory. If a step works only because someone already knows the trick, the workflow is not documented clearly enough yet.

## What This Page Answers

- how `bijux-canon-reason` is installed, run, diagnosed, and released in practice
- which checked-in files and tests anchor the operational story
- where a maintainer should look first when the package behaves differently

## Reviewer Lens

- verify that setup, workflow, and release statements still match package metadata and current commands
- check that operational guidance still points at real diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that maintainer advice still works under current local and CI expectations

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how `bijux-canon-reason` is expected to be operated, but it does not replace package metadata, actual runtime behavior, or validation in a real environment. A workflow is only trustworthy if a maintainer can still repeat it from the checked-in assets named here.

## Next Checks

- move to interfaces when the operational path depends on a specific surface contract
- move to quality when the question becomes whether the workflow is sufficiently proven
- move back to architecture when operational complexity suggests a structural problem

## Purpose

This page makes common package workflows easier to repeat consistently.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the actual package structure and tests.
