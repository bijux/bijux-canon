# Module Map

The architecture of `bijux-canon-reason` becomes readable when its major module
groups are treated as responsibilities instead of as folders. This page should
help a reviewer move from a question about behavior to the part of the package
most likely to answer it.

When this page is useful, code reading becomes targeted rather than exploratory.

Treat the architecture pages for `bijux-canon-reason` as a reviewer-facing map of structure and flow. They should shorten code reading, not try to replace it.

## Major Modules

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/planning` for plan construction and intermediate representation
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning` for claim and reasoning semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/execution` for step execution and tool dispatch
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/verification` for checks and validation outcomes
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/traces` for trace replay and diff support
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/interfaces` for CLI and serialization boundaries

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/planning` for plan construction and intermediate representation
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning` for claim and reasoning semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/execution` for step execution and tool dispatch

## Use This Page When

- you are tracing structure, execution flow, or dependency pressure
- you need to understand how modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing design drift rather than one isolated bug

## Decision Rule

Use `Module Map` to decide whether a structural change makes `bijux-canon-reason` easier or harder to explain in terms of modules, dependency direction, and execution flow. If the change works only because the design becomes harder to read, the safer answer is redesign rather than acceptance.

## What This Page Answers

- how `bijux-canon-reason` is organized internally in terms a reviewer can follow
- which modules carry the main execution and dependency story
- where structural drift would show up before it becomes expensive

## Reviewer Lens

- trace the described execution path through the named modules instead of trusting the diagram alone
- look for dependency direction or layering that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that the structural risks named here still match the current code shape

## Honesty Boundary

This page describes the current structural model of `bijux-canon-reason`, but it does not guarantee that every import path or runtime path still obeys that model. Readers should treat it as a map that must stay aligned with code and tests, not as an authority above them.

## Next Checks

- move to interfaces when the review reaches a public or operator-facing seam
- move to operations when the concern becomes repeatable runtime behavior
- move to quality when you need proof that the documented structure is still protected

## Purpose

This page provides a shortest-path code map for the package.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the actual source directories under `packages/bijux-canon-reason`.
