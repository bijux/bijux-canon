# Error Model

The package error model should make it clear which failures are local validation issues,
which are dependency failures, and which are contract violations.

```

## Review Anchors

- inspect interface modules for operator-facing error shape
- inspect application and domain modules for orchestration failures
- inspect tests for the failure cases the package already protects

## Test Areas

- tests/unit for planning, reasoning, execution, verification, and interfaces
- tests/e2e for API, CLI, replay gates, retrieval reasoning, and smoke coverage
- tests/perf for retrieval benchmark coverage
- tests/docs for documentation-linked safeguards

## Purpose

This page records how to reason about failures in architecture review.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the actual error-handling behavior and tests.
