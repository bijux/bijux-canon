# Execution Model

`bijux-canon-reason` executes work by receiving inputs at its interfaces, coordinating policy
and workflows in application code, and delegating specific responsibilities to owned modules.

## Execution Anchors

- entry surfaces: CLI app in src/bijux_canon_reason/interfaces/cli, HTTP app in src/bijux_canon_reason/api/v1, schema files in apis/bijux-canon-reason/v1
- workflow modules: src/bijux_canon_reason/planning, src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning, src/bijux_canon_reason/execution
- outputs: reasoning traces and replay diffs, claim and verification outcomes, evaluation suite artifacts

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/planning` for plan construction and intermediate representation
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning` for claim and reasoning semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/execution` for step execution and tool dispatch

## Use This Page When

- you are tracing internal structure or execution flow
- you need to understand where modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing architectural drift instead of one local bug

## What This Page Answers

- how bijux-canon-reason is structured internally
- which modules control the main execution path
- where architectural drift would become visible first

## Reviewer Lens

- trace the claimed execution path through the listed modules
- look for dependency direction that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that architectural risks still match the current code structure

## Honesty Boundary

This page describes the current structural model of bijux-canon-reason, but it does not by itself prove that every import or runtime path still obeys that model.

## Purpose

This page summarizes the package execution model before readers inspect individual modules.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the actual workflow code and entrypoints.

## Core Claim

The architectural claim of `bijux-canon-reason` is that its structure is deliberate enough for a reviewer to trace responsibilities, dependencies, and drift pressure without reverse-engineering the entire codebase.

## Why It Matters

If the architecture pages for `bijux-canon-reason` are weak, refactors become guesswork and dependency drift can hide until failures show up in tests or production-facing behavior.
