# Dependency Direction

The package should keep dependency direction readable: domain intent near the center,
interfaces and infrastructure at the edges.

## Directional Reading Order

- domain and model concerns under the core module groups
- application orchestration that composes domain behavior
- interfaces, APIs, and adapters that sit at the boundary

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/bijux_canon_reason/planning` for plan construction and intermediate representation
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/reasoning` for claim and reasoning semantics
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/execution` for step execution and tool dispatch
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/verification` for checks and validation outcomes
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/traces` for trace replay and diff support
- `src/bijux_canon_reason/interfaces` for CLI and serialization boundaries

## Purpose

This page makes dependency direction explicit enough to review during refactors.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with current imports and directory responsibilities.
