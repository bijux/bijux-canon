# Change Validation

Validation after a change should target the package surfaces that were actually touched.

```

## Validation Targets

- interface changes should update interface docs and owning tests
- artifact changes should update artifact docs and consuming tests
- architectural changes should update section pages that explain the package seam

## Test Anchors

- tests/unit for planning, reasoning, execution, verification, and interfaces
- tests/e2e for API, CLI, replay gates, retrieval reasoning, and smoke coverage
- tests/perf for retrieval benchmark coverage
- tests/docs for documentation-linked safeguards

## Use This Page When

- you are reviewing tests, invariants, limitations, or risk
- you need evidence that the documented contract is actually protected
- you are deciding whether a change is done rather than merely implemented

## What This Page Answers

- what proves the bijux-canon-reason contract today
- which risks or limits still need explicit review
- what a reviewer should verify before accepting change

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the documented proof strategy with the current test layout
- look for limitations or risks that should have been updated by recent changes
- verify that the page's definition of done still reflects real validation practice

## Honesty Boundary

This page explains how bijux-canon-reason protects itself, but it does not claim that prose alone is enough without the listed tests, checks, and review practice.

## Purpose

This page records how to choose meaningful validation for package work.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the package's current test layout and docs structure.
