# SBOM and Supply Chain

Supply-chain visibility is a repository maintenance concern, so SBOM helpers
live in `bijux-canon-dev` instead of being duplicated by each package.

The point is not just compliance. The point is to keep dependency and build
provenance explainable at repository level without smearing that burden
across every product package.

These maintainer pages should read like explicit operational memory for repository-health work. They are strongest when they expose automation intent, package impact, and repository policy without pretending that CI logs are documentation.

## Current Surfaces

- `sbom/requirements_writer.py`
- `tests/test_sbom_requirements_writer.py`
- shared dependency metadata in package `pyproject.toml` files

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-canon-dev/src/bijux_canon_dev` for maintainer helpers
- `packages/bijux-canon-dev/tests` for executable maintenance proof
- `apis/` and root workflows for repository-level integration points

## Use This Page When

- you are changing repository automation, validation, or release support
- you need maintainer-only context that should not live in product package docs
- you are reviewing CI, schema drift, or supply-chain behavior

## Decision Rule

Use `SBOM and Supply Chain` to decide whether a change belongs to maintainer automation or to a product package contract. If the change would affect end-user behavior directly, this page should push the review back toward the owning product package instead of letting maintainer scope sprawl.

## What This Page Answers

- which repository maintenance concern this page explains
- which maintainer modules or tests support that concern
- what a reviewer should confirm before changing repository automation

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the described maintainer behavior with the actual helper modules and tests
- check that maintainer-only guidance has not leaked into product-facing pages
- confirm that repository automation still names its package impact explicitly

## Next Checks

- move to product package docs if the question is user-facing behavior rather than repository health
- open the relevant helper module or test after using this page to orient yourself
- return to repository handbook pages when the maintainer issue turns out to be root policy instead

## Honesty Boundary

This section can describe maintainer automation and repository health work, but it should never imply that maintainer tooling is part of the end-user product surface. It also should not pretend that hidden scripts count as documentation just because CI happens to run them.

## Purpose

This page explains the home for supply-chain oriented repository tooling.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the checked-in SBOM helpers and tests.
